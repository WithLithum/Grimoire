# Grimoire

Grimoire is a .NET-based framework for validating Brigadier commands.

It works by defining the overall "archetype" of parameters and commands beforehand, and validate each nodes of the command based on the archetype. Where validating with Brigadier itself requires a one-to-one definition in Brigadier which defining commands in it is a great complexity.

## Usage

Grimoire already defines a basic command type archetype and archetypes for all parameter types supported by Brigadier on its own.
